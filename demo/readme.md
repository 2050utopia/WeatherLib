WeatherLib
==========

Android weather lib for creating easily weather app. The lib implements several protocols to get weather information from the most important weather data provider.

This is a demo app that shows to you how to use the library to build a weather app.
The app gets the current weather information including:

* Temperature
* Min and Max temperature
* Pressure
* Humidity
* Clouds
* Next days forecast

You can search your city using the search city screen. It supports metric and imperial system units and multiple language forecast
if you use Openweathermap as weather provider.

The app had moreover, a setting interface where you can configure the app parameters.
The app isn't production-ready the UI and UX must be improved but it is a good starting point if you want to know how to
use the *WeatherLib*.
